It facilitates transactions and state transitions through Consensus Nodes, supported by off-chain modules like INTERX and RYOKAI for scalable execution and storage. As a hypermodular network hub, SEKAI streamlines user balance settlements, secures RollApp layers, and manages data/token transfers. It simplifies dApp deployment by enabling Consensus Nodes to act as Executors for RollApps, fostering a decentralized verification and execution system incentivized by KIRA’s liquidity protocols."
